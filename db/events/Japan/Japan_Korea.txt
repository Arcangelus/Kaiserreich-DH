desc = EVT_260000_DESC	#Manchuria and Primorye are home to many Korean armed activities. Though both areas are under the Japanese influence, being 'frontier' region our authority is much weaker than that in the Korean Peninsula. Manchuria's long border with Russia and Primorye's sea access has enabled Koreans to smuggle arms and munitions. By the 1930s, eliminating Korean 'banditry' became one of our main goals in the area, and to this end the our forces had launched several military campaigns against Korean 'bandits', without much success.

Economically the Peninsula serves as a vital source of cheap staple foods for the Empire's growing population. But the twenty and seven years of continued political suppression and economic subjugation made the local resentment against the Japanese rule permanent. Having various privileges not found in any other Kenpeitai units, the Kenpeitai in Korea worked hard to curb dissent, but arresting and hunting down malcontents weren't enough to subdue the population. The recent Kenpeitai intelligence indicates the existence of a large underground separatist group and its contacts with various Korean armed activities in abroad. It is clear that the current situation is no longer sustainable, but what should be done?

During the final phase of the Weltkrieg, those exiled independence activists gathered in Shanghai to establish the Hanguk Imsi Jeongbu (shortend Imjeong) or Korean Provisional Government, the supposed highest authority and representative of the Korean independence movement. The Imjeong actively lobbied Berlin for independence, but soon found itself in a diplomatic isolation when the Peace with Honour reaffirmed the Japanese possession of the Korean Peninsula. Torn by external and internal pressure, the Imjeong struggled to remain relevant, launching various assassination campaigns against the Japanese. Since the uprising the Imjeong sought to reassert its primacy, and today the 'Provisional Government' has demanded recognition of its authority. The demand infuriated the Socialists, but the Imjeong is widely respected and honoured within the Nationalist movement and burning the bridge with it would alienate many.

desc = EVT_260068_DESC	#The current leadership of the war, the Joseon Geonguk Junbi Wiwonhoe (shortend Geonjun) or Committee for the Preparation of Korean Independence, has its origin in an underground resistance coalition of the Nationalists and the Socialists named Joseon Geonguk Dongmaeng (Korean Restoration Brotherhood), formed by the moderate Socialist Yeo Un-hyeong. Currently both the Nationalists and the Socialists are represented in the Geonjun with a Nationalist majority, but the Socialist participation has been steadily increasing both at the battlefield and at the local administration. For this reason there has been calls from the Socialists to reorganise the Geonjun leadership to a Socialist majority.

Many Socialist-led branches have enacted varying social reforms on their own without any authorisation from the central leadership, and in some rare cases, confiscations and redistributions of land were reported. The Nationalists consider these actions illegitimate, and has urged the Geonjun leadership to take action.
