The first favoured by the Unione Socialista Cristiana would focus on the various communes throughout the country and focus on decentralizing the industry. The second plan put forth by the Unione Nazionalista is nearly the exact opposite. It instead would favor creating an organization called the Istituto per la Ricostruzione Industriale(Institute for Industrial Reconstruction) that will organize guide the syndicates and unions to bring prosparity for the people."
