desc = EVT_1_DESC # Egypt during the Weltkrieg was a British colony and as such it was forced to join in a war that it did not care for. It’s leader Abbas II was removed by the British and the abuses of colonial officers were ignored in the name of the war effort. Though spared fighting on their soil, Egyptians faced martial law, rising food prices, and strikes in Alexandria and Cairo in 1918. Hopes for greater autonomy were dashed when the war ended in 1921, as British military presence was expanded, and the sympathetic High Commissioner Wingate being replaced with a far stricter man. The late creation of a 1924 Constitution would see the nationalist Wafd party sweeping elections the following year, and events in faraway Britain would send shockwaves through Egyptian society. As revolution took hold in Britain, Cairo’s Tramway Workers launched a strike of their own, inspiring yet more Egyptians to strike and boycott. The situation would deteriorate for Britain, and by October of 1926 Egypt would be declared an independent nation. The Suez Canal would be lost however, as jealous German forces would seize it and threaten the nascent state with war if they tried to contest it. With few friends, and the threat of Ottoman sympathizers in the aristocracy and the old Khedive Abbas II, Sa’d Zaghlul would declare The Republic of Egypt. He and his party would dominate and secularize Egypt until his death in 1930, as Wafd would fall apart and his successor Nahhas would become massively corrupt. The collapse of the cotton industry in the late 1920s combined with the publishing of a ‘black book’ of Nahhas’s corruption in 1934 would see General Aziz Ali al-Misri depose him. Elected as leader of Egypt the next year, Al-Misri now faces the task of rebuilding Egypt’s economy and preparing for The Third Arab Congress, set for the summer of 1936…

Soldiers mutinied as British troops retreated to the Suez Canal. The Palace of Faud I was stormed and he was deposed. For the first time in many hundreds of years the Egyptian people were free to make their own way. We shall spread that freedom to the rest of the Arab World when we strike down the Porte!
