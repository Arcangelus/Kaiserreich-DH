The Rashidi emir Saud bin Abdulaziz remained neutral during the Arab Campaign and maintained cordial relations with the Turks, which allowed him to maintain a certain amount of autonomy from Istanbul. However, the Ottoman administration and authority has suffered greatly since the Arab Congress and bin Abdulaziz, opportunist to the very core, is starting to get worried what his fate would be once a successful Arab uprising displaces his Turkish overlords. Now might be a good time to offer, discretely of course, the emir a way out.
