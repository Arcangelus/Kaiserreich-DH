1. Patagonia, Paraguay, and Uruguay (U01) are on the map and fully functioning. 
2. Patagonia has all Rad Soc and further left ministers that Argentina used to have
3. They have the starting leaders and tech teams that they have in HOI4. None have pictures
4. Minor province adjustments were made in Argentina and Patagonia
5. Argentina, Patagonia, Chile, Uruguay, and Paraguay have been given governments as close to their HOI4 starts as possible
If the minister is not in DH yet it is noted in their scenario file.
6. Patagonia has shield and small flags. Needs NATO unit counter still
7. Somehow accidentally changed thee tech compnent graphics to HOI2 version. If this is not the case when you downloaded it please disregard.
