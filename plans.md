# Korea Rework

## Introduction

Korea is located at the crossroads of the three most significant powers in East Asia: Japan, China, and Russia. In the current version of KR:DH, there is a conditional Korean uprising in 1937 which serves as one of the various initial challenges for Japan. This rework strives to expand the uprising to a more complex chain of events that:
* elevates Korea to a fun and "viable" nation to play as, with event chains regarding the war for independence, post-war domestic politics, and foreign policies.
* grants Japan additional ways to review its policy towards its colonies/client states and strengthen the overall power of the Co-Prosperity Sphere.
* grants Fengtian and Transamur early chances to choose whether to cooperate with Japan and be rewarded with its economical/military assistance, or join Korea and attempt a break-off from Japanese control.
* while adding contents that would offer the human player with diverse interesting paths, do NOT make changes that would result in impractical political landscapes in the region in too many games.

## Timeline IRL

* 1910: Japanese supremacy over the Korean penninsula, cemented by its victories [over Qing in 1895](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Sino-Japanese_War) and [over Russia in 1905](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russo-Japanese_War) and a [secret agreement with the US](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taft%E2%80%93Katsura_agreement) allows the Empire to annex Korea into its realm.
* 1918: The idea of [Self-Determination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-determination), strongly encouraged by Woodrow Wilson and Vladmir Lenin, sparks a new hope of independence/autonomy in the hearts of Koreans.
