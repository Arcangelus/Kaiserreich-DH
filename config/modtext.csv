BSR_NAME;1925 British Revolution;;;;;;;;;;x
BSR_U07;Britain was already defeated before the Peace with Honour. The second battle for Jutland undermined the power of the Royal Navy, and the Spring Offensive undermined geopolitical power. After the war the country plunged into depression, faced famine, unemployment, and distrust of power. In the December 1921 elections, the majority won the Conservatives, the seats were won by the Labour and Nationals, and the Liberals split between supporters and opponents of the alliance with Bonar Law. The Prime Minister, who was ill with laryngeal cancer, offered in 1923 his seat to the Marquees Curzon of Kedleston. Under attack for the breach of democratic protocol and destabilizing of a slumping economy, the Tories called an election less than a year later to win a mandate. The results of which for the Conservatives were a disaster: majority was preserved only with the help of a coalition with the National. At the beginning of 1925, tariffs on goods from Germany and its puppet states were introduced in strict form, such a decision initially brought about a short-term rise in production. However, Germany introduced its own tariffs on British goods, and shipped goods through Denmark, Norway and the Netherlands. The coal industry was the worst hit: the loss of the market has devastated entrepreneurs who laid off workers and lowed wages with others. Thus, the Trade Union Congress announced the beginning of a general strike on March 7. Loyalists are unreasonably afraid of escalating the strike into mass unrest. If not quickly pacified, Britain will be doomed.;;;;;;;;;;x
BSR_ENG;Trade Union Congress emerged in the 1860s, and since 1897 has positioned itself as a centralized union structure that uses a more militant approach to combating employers and even achieving a socialist transformation of society. Currently, the TUC includes 4 million workers, whose numbers have increased since the Great War. The seven-year conflict with the Central Powers has become a tragedy not only in terms of casualties. The illusion of Britain's domination of the world subsided long before the Peace with Honour was signed. Prolonged depression began, people were starving, businesses shut down on rails. The 'Wartime Coalition' paid for its defeat in the December 1921 election, where Liberals not only yielded to the majority of Conservatives but were divided on a party-by-party basis. The opposition was Labour, which included a faction of workers and radicals. In the 1924 election, the Independent Labour Party, which occupies a more left position, increased representation to 35 MPs, and announced the purpose of removing Curzon's cabinet in any way. Of particular concern was the introduction of tariffs on German goods, which initially gave a short-term positive effect. But the mirror response of the Reich doomed the industry to stagnation. The disadvantaged workers who are TUC members are openly inclined to overthrow the government and establish the sovereignty of the working class. After the failure of the compromise, it was not surprising that the statement of readiness to strike on March 7 was strongly supported by trade unionists, nationalists and radicals. There is no doubt that resistance in the event of dispersal will be tough, and this is the starting point of the Revolution.;;;;;;;;;;x
78003desc;It was sunny in London until a terrifying roar broke the silence. Violence erupted in the rebel-held capital. A group of anarchists gathered in the middle of Buckingham Palace, stormed the gates, surrounded the building and went inside. Without hesitation, they rushed to the royal residences and killed the king and his family. It is rumored that from the beginning of the strike they had to sail to Canada and stay safe. Be that as it may, the Monarchy is in mourning, and the British are shocked and confused by the threat of a strike.;+;+;+;+;;;+;;;;X
78029desc;No one expected that the history that Britain would bring to dominate the world would loudly undermine it. Economic, political, humanitarian collapse, caused by the war with Germany, broke the nest of discord. Especially got to the miners who have to endorse the coal blockade. The United Kingdom is likely to face one of the strongest challenges: the TUC convenes a general strike on March 6. It is necessary to curb the flames as soon as possible, as long as it does not bury Britain in the chaos. A gloomy and hopeless spring promises to be fateful.;+;+;+;+;;;+;;;;X
78030desc;Enough! The bourgeoisie, which has brought Britain to a bloody nightmare, has risen above grief and despair, anger and hatred. People who suffer from their pride must serve them! They hoped that 'imperial tariffs' would heal the wound of the war: everything was in vain. From everywhere there are intentions to overthrow the old way. Preparations for a strike that touched millions of Britons began yesterday. Let the elite shake away from the rumble of the people and the Red Flag of this spring will be over.;+;+;+;+;;;+;;;;X
78031desc;The strike, which began as a peaceful avalanche, spread across Britain, reaching more and more people. Maclean's and Mosley's light-hearted speeches united indifferent workers. Fearful loyalists fled to Canada for weeks, leaving the country in the hands of the common people. Under the Red Flag, Parliament passed an act transferring power to the Trade Union Congress and dissolving itself. Out of the chaos emerges the syndicalist Union of Britain, which is only beginning to defend the interests of the proletariat.;;;;;;;;;;;X
78032desc;The strike, which began as a peaceful one, swept much of Britain. But loyalists were quick to navigate, slowing the progress of the trade unionists. As of now, there is a draw that means nothing. But the advantage of the Revolution was in the people who trusted in the overthrow of the capitalist system. And the day will come when a long struggle will bring a long-awaited triumph, but clearly not today.;;;;;;;;;;;X
78033desc;The Royal Army met angry protesters in full alert. With the least losses, we were able to put inexperienced strikers in place. The High Court found the strike illegal and the workers agreed to our demands. The United Kingdom is waking up from a prolonged depression, proving that the world map is not lost. The Royal Family solemnly returned from Canada, and a standing ovation was carried out by the citizens at Buckingham Palace. From here, George V said, 'No longer will anyone be allowed to encroach on the greatness of the British Empire. It is awakened!';;;;;;;;;;;X
78034desc;The insurgency was not easy, and now it has been a relentless draw. Yet loyalists stood in their hands and disorganized the trade unionists. The situation was normalized by divisions that came from Canada, and a further picture emerges in favor of King's supporters. And now for the sake of the result, we should wait.;;;;;;;;;;;X
